## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Going straight to the point,  the border-bottom at the base of the design gave me problem. Also, making my unordered list and ordered list on the same line and changing their colors because i never i could use marker until i googled it. With the help of Google and ability to recall what i've learnt so far, I was able to complete the challenge. 


<h1>Some CSS code I'm proud of</h1>

```css
table tr {
    border-bottom: 1px solid var(--LightGrey);
  }
  
  table tr:last-child {
    border: 0;
  }

  li::marker {
    color: var(--Nutmeg);
}
```
